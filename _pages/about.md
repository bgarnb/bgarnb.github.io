Introduction
======

I am a member of the Special Teaching Staff (E.DI.P.) at the Department of Audio and Visual Arts of the Ionian University. I also participate in the Institute of Games Research (IGR),the Interactive Arts Laboratory (In.Arts), the Gaming Gamification research group, and the 'Avarts Live Game Hub' initiative.

My academic and research interests include interactive multimedia and games, both digital and analog. I also explore gamification, game design methodologies that serve purposes beyond entertainment, and strategies for integrating content from various disciplines into games.

Additionally, I have a strong research interest in the design and implementation of innovative, fully developed game systems in augmented and virtual reality within the metaverse, aimed at meeting the interactive needs of specific user groups.

Finally, I have participated in projects related to games, gamification, and learning within game-based environments
