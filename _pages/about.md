======
I am a post doc researcher and my main interest concerns the use of Digital Games for Learning purposes. I have been engaged with different approaches of Game-based Learning, such as the Game Design Process, the Integration of Educational Content in the Gameplay Mechanics, the Collaborative Perspective of Digital Games, and the idea of Game Making for learning purposes. Although Computing Education is my primary skill, I have also been engaged with Science Education and Mathematics Applications.
